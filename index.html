    <h3>Mary Ferrer</h3>
    <h5>Web Developer</h5>
    <p>I'm a first generation Filipino-American currently residing in Washington state. Like many of my fellow Asian-Americans, I was encouraged to pursue the sciences and have a degree in Biology. I love the sciences but I've always had an affinity towards technology. Growing up, I was drawn to video games, the internet, and racked with a curiousity for how it all worked. Like many others, my first taste of coding started with customizing the HTML for my always evolving MySpace profile backgrounds. Now, I want to use my scientific background and professional experience in Biotech to transition into the Tech industry with the hopes of making solutions that improve our everday lives! On a less formal note, I enjoy solving problems creatively and effectively and learning new skills along the way.</p>
